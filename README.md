# DocStream

DocStream is a polished, real-time document workspace. Create, share, and co-edit without friction while every version and permission stays under control.

## What you can do
- Write together and see changes land instantly.
- Share with view, comment, or edit access — including expiring links.
- Roll back to any saved version when you need a do-over.
- Keep teams and workspaces separated and secure.
